Readme file for hmailer.php, version 2.1.

HMailer
=======
HMailer is a PHP class which uses HMailer.exe from an Inet.Mail or
Inet.Mail Pro sofware installation to send an e-mail message.  Inet.Mail
is an OS/2 only program, and so is useless (at least without modification)
on all other platforms.

The HMailer package is available at http://hobbes.nmsu.edu .

VERY LITTLE TESTING HAS BEEN DONE.  USE AT YOUR OWN RISK.

Mailing List
============
There is a mailing list for support.  Please subscribe if you intend
to use the HMailer class.  This will allow me to send update notices.
I expect traffic to be light becaue there are few users and few updates.
However, there may be many bugs.  There is no advertising added to
the messages.

To subscribe to the mailing list, send the following e-mail message to
phpmailer-request@norp5424b.hsc.usc.edu :

  subscribe phpmailer
  end

To post a message to the list, send it as an e-mail to
phpmailer@norp5424b.hsc.usc.edu .

To remove yourself from the mailing list, send the following e-mail
message to phpmailer-request@norp5424b.hsc.usc.edu :

  unsubscribe phpmailer
  end
