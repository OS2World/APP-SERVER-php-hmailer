News file for hmailer.php, 2.0.

A few unnumbered versions of my HMailer class were mailed out
privately.  These should be considered 1.x versions.

Version 2.1 changes

  Bugfixes only, mostly in attachment handling.

Version 2.0 changes

  E-mail attachemnts are now supported.  The Content-Transfer-Encoding's
  supported are 7bit, 8bit, and base64.  No actual encoding is done for
  7bit or 8bit.  In particular, it is up to the calling program to make
  sure that a 7bit attachment really is 7-bit clean.  WARNING.  Sending
  e-mail with attachments can be slow, especially when you have multiple
  recipients.  You may extend beyond your PHP max_execution_time setting.

  The semi-private member variable 'message' has been renamed to
  'mainbody'.  The name 'mainbody' is used for the main part of an
  e-mail message, the part that's readable when you open the message
  in your e-mail client and which does not include the attachements.
  The name 'message' is used for the entire message as sent including
  attachments.  Previously, e-mail attachments were not supported.

  The $specarray parameter used by the mail() and setspec() methods
  was always a hash array.  It now supports the following new keys:

     'replyto'  --  Specifies the Replyto: address
     'parts'    --  A scalar array of attachments
     'mainbody' --  The main message body.
  
  The 'mainbody' key is intended to replace the 'message' key.
  The 'message' key is retained as a synonym for 'message' but is now
  depricated.

  The Replyto: header is now supported in the same fashion as the
  From: header.

  A new member variable has been added:  $this->version' holds the
  version number.
